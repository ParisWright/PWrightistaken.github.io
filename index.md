Upincoming CyberSec Professional

https://www.linkedin.com/in/paris-wright-57342b263 

#README
With a strong dedication to the cybersecurity field, Iâ€™m pursuing my studies at college while consistently expanding my skill set through industry-recognized certifications. These credentials have equipped me with foundational knowledge in areas like network security, threat detection, and vulnerability management. They also enhance my understanding of the latest technologies and best practices, allowing me to tackle complex security challenges with confidence.

Alongside my academic coursework, I stay up-to-date with emerging trends and threats in cybersecurity. This includes exploring cutting-edge topics, such as ethical hacking and incident response, to build a well-rounded skill set. My goal is to leverage this knowledge and hands-on experience to secure digital environments, defend against cyber threats, and ultimately contribute to a safer digital world.

## Python project that verifies an employee

        raise TypeError("username must be a string")
    if minlen < 1:
        raise ValueError("minlen must be at least 1")
    
    # Usernames can't be shorter than minlen
    if len(username) < minlen:
        return False
    # Usernames can only use letters, numbers, dots and underscores
    if not re.match('^[a-z0-9._]*$', username):
        return False
    # Usernames can't begin with a number
